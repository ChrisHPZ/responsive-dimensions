# responsive-dimensions
This is a small project I started because I wanted to have a responsive framework I'm familiar with.  No better way to do this than code one myself.

Note: If you would like to fork or contribute to this project, by all means do so.  However it will be necessary to have a development server set up on your local computer such as XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP.
Reason being is the HTML is being rendered through a series of PHP for loops.  No reason to display HTML the hard way.
